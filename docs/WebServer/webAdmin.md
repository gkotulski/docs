## Overview

You can monitor your running 4D Server applications through the Web. An embedded web server component, dedicated to server administration, can be used to communicate with the 4D Server application from one side, and to a browser or a web application from the other side.

This feature is specially useful for 4D Server applications running headless - but can also be used with 4D Server applications with interfaces.
